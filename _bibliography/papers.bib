  abstract = {Heavy electrons with extremely strong Coulomb repulsions can condense into a fully gapped s-wave superconducting state.           ,                             In exotic superconductors, including high-               T               c               copper oxides, the interactions mediating electron Cooper pairing are widely considered to have a magnetic rather than a conventional electron-phonon origin. Interest in this exotic pairing was initiated by the 1979 discovery of heavy-fermion superconductivity in CeCu               2               Si               2               , which exhibits strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations. A hallmark of unconventional pairing by anisotropic repulsive interactions is that the superconducting energy gap changes sign as a function of the electron momentum, often leading to nodes where the gap goes to zero. We report low-temperature specific heat, thermal conductivity, and magnetic penetration depth measurements in CeCu               2               Si               2               , demonstrating the absence of gap nodes at any point on the Fermi surface. Moreover, electron irradiation experiments reveal that the superconductivity survives even when the electron mean free path becomes substantially shorter than the superconducting coherence length. This indicates that superconductivity is robust against impurities, implying that there is no sign change in the gap function. These results show that, contrary to long-standing belief, heavy electrons with extremely strong Coulomb repulsions can condense into a fully gapped s-wave superconducting state, which has an on-site attractive pairing interaction.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            A long-standing theoretical prediction is that in clean, nodal unconventional superconductors the magnetic penetration depth               {$\lambda$}               , at zero temperature, varies linearly with magnetic field. This non-linear Meissner effect is an equally important manifestation of the nodal state as the well studied linear-in-               T               dependence of               {$\lambda$}               , but has never been convincingly experimentally observed. Here we present measurements of the nodal superconductors CeCoIn               5               and LaFePO which clearly show this non-linear Meissner effect. We further show how the effect of a small dc magnetic field on               {$\lambda$}               (               T               ) can be used to distinguish gap nodes from non-nodal deep gap minima. Our measurements of KFe               2               As               2               suggest that this material has such a non-nodal state.},
