I am on my way to Nagasaki where I will be attending the [38th International Symposium on Superconductivity (ISS2025)](https://www.iss2025.jp/). I am very happy to have been invited and I will be presenting our latest work on EuFe$$_2$$(As$$_{1-x}$$P$$_x$$)$$_2$$ ([PC5-03-INV](https://pub.confit.atlas.jp/en/event/iss2025/presentation/PC5-03)).
