My name is Joseph Wilcox. I am an experimental physicist working predominantly on the magnetic properties of unconventional superconductors. Since 2023, I have been working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Bath in the U.K with Professor Simon Bending. My expertise is in performing low temperature electrical and magnetic measurements, though I have further experience working with very high magnetic fields, large hydostatic pressures, heat capacity measurements, semiconductor processing / microfabrication techniques, and dry transfer of 2D materials.

I completed both my undergraduate degree (2014) and my PhD (2019) at the University of Bristol, U.K., with Professor Antony Carrington. During this time, I was interested in exploring the structure of the superconducting energy gap in unconventional superconducting materials using very low temperature magnetic measurements. After finishing my PhD, I stayed on as a postdoctoral researcher where I investigated the landscape of competing electronic orders in the cuprate superconductors using a combination of high magnetic fields and large hydrostatic pressures in order to suppress the very strong superconducting order parameter. During my time in Bristol, my greatest achievement was clearly demonstrating the existence of the [non-linear Meissner effect](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28790-y) - a phenonemon that had eluded observation for more than 30 years.

Most recently I have been investigating some unusual materials that exhibits coexisting superconductivity and magnetism - two phases of matter that tend to be mutually antagonistic. In one of these materials, the two orders are able to coexist over a wide range of temperature, giving rise to unsual and entirely novel magnetic behaviours. [You can view a recording here 🎥](https://youtu.be/9JR6LI97IOc) of my recent invited talk at the 38th International Symposium on Superconductivity (December 2025) where I present my recent results on this topic.

<!-- I received my PhD in 2019 from the University of Bristol, where I worked with Prof. Antony Carrington. My research was focused on using magnetic penetration depth measurements to probe the structure of the superconducting gap in several low $$T_c$$ materials. Notably, we made a clear observation of the the non-linear Meissner effect, a key prediction of the semi-classical theory of nodal superconductors that had otherwise eluded decisive detection ([read about it here!](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28790-y)).

Following my PhD, I stayed at Bristol for a few more years working as a postdoctoral researcher. During this time, I worked on quite a variety of different projects, mostly involving exploring the landscape of competing electronic orders in the cuprate superconductors. In particular, I made substantial contributions to the development of two novel measurement techniques; one exploring the superfluid density under high pressures and the other exploring very high-speed, high-field caloric measurements. While these techniques have not yet reached full maturity, progress continues to be made and will hopefully bear fruit eventually (as is often the way of research).

Since July 2023, I have been working in the group of Prof. Simon Bending at the University of Bath. Here my research has been focused on an unusual family of iron-based superconductors that, in addition to being superconducting, also exhibit coexisting magnetic order (both ferro- and antiferromagnetic). Superconductivity and magnetism (particularly ferromagnetism) are usually antagonistic phenomena, which often leads to the destruction of one or the other as a consequence. However, in these materials, the two orders are able to coexist over a surprisingly wide range of temperatures, which gives rise to some very unusual behaviour. You can read about my latest research on the topic [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-025-00833-z). -->
