Hello, my name is Joseph (Alec) Wilcox, though you can also call me Joe. I am an experimental physicist working in the field of condensed matter. More specifically, I am interested in the fundamental physics of unconventional superconductors with a view to gaining insight into what makes them work.

I am currently based at the University of Bath, in the group of Professor Simon Bending, where my research is focused on some unusual superconductors that also exhibit coexisting magnetic order. I utilise a number low temperature methods to explore these materials' response to magnetic fields in order to understand the unusual mixture of superconductivity and magnetism.

My PhD research, carried out at the University of Bristol, was also in the field of unconventional superconductivity, where I was looking at the structure of the superconducting gap in several low $$T_c$$ materials.

My homepage is still under construction, so check back in the future for more updates. In the meantime, have a look at my most recent paper [here](/publications).

*Fun fact*: the "Alec" in my name is after famous space wizard Sir Alec Guinness.
