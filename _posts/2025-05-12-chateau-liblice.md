## SuperQumap

Last week, I had the great pleasure to attend the European COST Action CA21144 [SuperQumap](https://superqumap.eu/) Conference 2025 on "[Superconducting Nanodevices and Quantum Materials for Coherent Manipulation: Topological States in Superconductors and Magnets](https://superqumap.eu/superconducting-nanodevices-and-quantum-materials-for-coherent-manipulation-topological-states-in-superconductors-and-magnetic-materials-liblice-chateau-czech-republic-5th-9th-may-2025/)". This conference not only has possibly the longest ever conference name (needs to be checked!) but it was also held in arguably one of the most regal settings for a physics conference: the Baroque castle in the village of [Liblice, Czechia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liblice). Somewhat surprisingly, the chateau now belongs to the Czech Academy of Sciences, which is certainly a very enviable asset.

The conference covered a broad spectrum of novel superconductivity, unusual topological states, nanostructured devices and exotic magnetism. I was very pleased to be invited to share [our results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04098) on vortex behaviour in the ferromagnetic superconductor EuFe$$_2$$(As$$_{1-x}$$P$$_x$$)$$_2$$. I was also very pleased to learn, on the day before my presentation, that our manuscript results was accepted for publication in [Communications Materials](https://www.nature.com/commsmat/)! The conference was also expertly organised by the local members of the COST Action group. Thank you, organisers!

In addition to the science, I had a great time having engaging discussions, enjoying some very tasty food, a very generous wine "tasting" (more like "drinking") and introducing some uninitiated to the wonders of Scotch whisky. Hope to see you guys again soon!
